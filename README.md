## Course Description

In this course, Playwright test automation specialist Qambar Raza guides you through the essentials of Selenium, a cornerstone of browser test automation, including how to write and run tests on both local machines and cloud-based platforms like GitHub Actions. Learn how to set up Selenium, grasp the intricacies of debugging, and capture evidence of test failures using screenshots. Gain proficiency in structuring tests with page object models and optimizing test execution through parallelization and Selenium Grid. Explore the techniques for leveraging Selenium Manager and integrating wire mock for efficient testing workflows. With each lesson building on the previous, this course actively engages you in fixing, coding, and running tests as a real-world test automation engineer.

## Instructions

This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches

The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter.
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
Add changes to git using this command: git add .
Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
